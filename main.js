const contacts = require('./data.json');

// the following exercises require the data from data.json.
// you can look in that file to see the data structure you
// will be working with. 

// For each exercise:
// 1. use array methods with the variable contacts to get the desired result, 
// 2. store the result with a variable
// 3. appropriately log the results to the console



//You can put your solutions after each comment below:

//1. an array that contains all of the contacts that work at INSECTUS

//2. an array all of the contacts, with only the name property

//3. an array of all of the contacts over the age of 50

//4. the first ten contacts when alphabetically ordered by name
